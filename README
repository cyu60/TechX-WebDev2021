# HW1

- Instructions:
    - Hmmm... there seems to be a semi-finished website here, let's see how we can customise it for our own:
        - Go to the html page:
            - Change the content to fit you rather than [[Chinat Yu]]
            - The title seems a bit off, change it to an H1 header
            - Change the references to the pdf and the image to fit your own
            - Add more profolios for your page
        - Go to the CSS page:
            - The 3 dots on the top of the page seems be all black, can we fix that?
                - Hint: red is `#FC6058`, yellow is `#FEC02F`, green is `#2ACA3E` 
                - SOLUTION
                    - ```javascript

#dot-1{
	background-color:  #FC6058;
}

#dot-2{
	background-color:  #FEC02F;
}

#dot-3{
	background-color:  #2ACA3E;
}```
            - Try and comment out some of the blocks and then refresh the page, do you notice any differences? eg height, width, display, boarder...
